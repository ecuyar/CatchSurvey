# CatchSurvey
 >A mobile survey program
 
 Generally, we are spending almost all of our time with smart phones.   
 We believe that one day all industries would do their operations by the help of mobile technologies.  
 For this reason, we decided to build our project on a mobile platform.  
 Usually polls disregarded or cannot be provided enough participants to get knowledge.  
 Even if participations found, no one has the time to fill out this survey.  
 Considering all these data, we have decided to make an application that will facilitate the work of survey companies and brands.  
 By determining the audience, we aim to enable the users to be active with different motivation tools.
